## Purpose
This toy project is for exploring interesting paradigms and modules - Functional Programming React with Redux.

## What I explored and used here
* basics of functional approach: compose, pipe, curry, stateless compoents only.
* react router v4 (params, query with query-string)
* async action with redux-thunk
* duck pattern with redux-actions
* selector pattern with reselect
* promise action handling with
* styled-component, scss
* normalizr
* applying hot loader after eject
* meta tag handling with react-helmet

# Planning
* immutable.js
* redux-saga
* Storybook
* Typescript or flow
